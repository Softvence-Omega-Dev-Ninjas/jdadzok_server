### API ENDPOINTS

#### Cap Level Management
```
GET    /cap-level/status/:userId       # Get user's current cap status
GET    /cap-level/requirements/:level  # Get requirements for specific level
POST   /cap-level/calculate/:userId    # Recalculate user's eligible level
PUT    /cap-level/promote/:userId      # Admin: Manual promotion
GET    /cap-level/metrics/:userId      # Get detailed user metrics
```

#### User Metrics
```
POST   /user-metrics/update/:userId    # Update user activity metrics
GET    /user-metrics/:userId           # Get user metrics summary
POST   /user-metrics/activity-score    # Calculate activity score
```

#### Revenue Sharing
```
GET    /revenue/user/:userId           # Get user's revenue history
POST   /revenue/calculate              # Calculate monthly revenue shares
GET    /revenue/stats                  # Platform revenue statistics
```


### ACTIVITY SCORING ALGORITHM

#### Engagement Metrics Weight
```typescript
interface ActivityScore {
  posts: number * 5;        // 5 points per post
  comments: number * 2;     // 2 points per comment
  likes: number * 1;        // 1 point per like given
  shares: number * 3;       // 3 points per share
  followers: number * 0.5;  // 0.5 points per follower
  volunteerHours: number * 10; // 10 points per volunteer hour
}
```

#### Level Promotion Logic
1. **GREEN → YELLOW**: Activity Score ≥ 50
2. **YELLOW → RED**: Activity Score ≥ 100 + Admin verification
3. **RED → BLACK**: 8-week volunteer service completion
4. **BLACK → OSTRICH_FEATHER**: Secret panel nomination

### VOLUNTEER INTEGRATION
- Track volunteer applications and project completions
- Verify 8-week service requirement for BLACK cap
- Integration with volunteer project management system

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES
- All cap level changes require database transactions for consistency
- Activity scores should be calculated in background jobs to avoid performance impact
- Revenue sharing calculations run monthly via scheduled tasks
- Comprehensive logging for all cap level promotions and demotions
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse of metrics calculation endpoints
