## üß† Optional Improvements (for V2+)

1. Text Similarity (NLP)
   Run keyword extraction on post text, compare to user interests (via embedding or TF-IDF).

2. Topic Clustering (ML)
   Analyze historical post content to cluster authors and users into topics (unsupervised).

3. Metadata Scoring
   Use PostMetadata (e.g. feelings, gifs, location) to improve feed matching.
   For example, show ‚Äúhappy‚Äù posts to users who often interact with similar content.

4. User Feedback Loop
   Adjust scoring based on:
   - Posts they liked/shared/commented
   - Posts they scrolled past quickly
